				<ul>
					<li><span>Acquired aplastic anaemia is a rare but life-threatening bone marrow disorder</span></li>
					<li><span>Patients may be asymptomatic until the disease becomes severe and requires treatment to restore haematopoiesis and safe blood count levels</span></li>
					<li><span>Bone marrow HSCT from an HLA-matched sibling is the standard of care and the only potentially curative treatment for severe aplastic anaemia</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>5-year survival may be greater than 70% in patients aged up to 40 years</span></li>
							<li><span>However, it is associated with a risk of transplant failure, GVHD and death</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span>Approximately one-third of patients with severe aplastic anaemia do not have a matched HSCT donor</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>IST may be considered in these patients, and repeat courses may be used as salvage therapy for severe aplastic anaemia relapse</span></li>
							<li><span>Alternative donor transplantation is associated with variable survival rates (43â€“94%) and increased risk of complications compared with matched sibling HSCT</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span>Despite improved supportive care, survival in patients who are refractory to IST but are not eligible for HSCT is still below 60%, highlighting the urgent and unmet need for effective non-transplantation treatment solutions</span></li>
