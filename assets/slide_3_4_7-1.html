				<ul>
					<li><span>Aplastic anaemia is characterised by haematopoietic failure and multilineage cytopenia</span></li>
					<li><span>Eltrombopag may stimulate haematopoiesis by non-competitive activation of TPO-R</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>The ability of TPO to act on progenitor stem cells supports a hypothetical role for TPO-R agonists in treating bone marrow failure</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li><span>In this first phase II clinical study of eltrombopag for the treatment of IST-refractory SAA, treatment was associated with: </span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Improved blood counts in â‰¥1 cell line compared with baseline, with a multilineage response observed over time</span></li>
							<li><span>Multilineage responses maintained over time (median duration of response >1 year) and trilineage responses maintained after discontinuation of eltrombopag</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>Associated with restoration of bone marrow cellularity and platelet and RBC transfusion-independent intervals of >6 months in a population that was transfusion dependent</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li><span>Eltrombopag at doses up to 150 mg daily was generally well tolerated in the phase II study</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Overall safety profile was consistent with the expected safety profile for patients with SAA and the established safety profile of eltrombopag in approved indications</span></li>
							<li><span>No new safety signals were detected</span></li>
							<li><span>However, an increased incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities, which are a known potential outcome for SAA, was noted with eltrombopag treatment</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>The clinical consequences of these changes require further study and, if observed during treatment with eltrombopag, it is recommended  that treatment with eltrombopag be discontinued</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li><span>Eltrombopag (PROMACTA/REVOLADE) is a breakthrough therapy that may change the treatment paradigm for SAA, by introducing a novel approach in the management of the disease</span></li>
