				        	<p><span>Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia:</span> form of leukaemia characterised by excess lymphoblasts</p>

				        	<p><span>Acute respiratory distress syndrome:</span> a severe, life-threatening reaction (in adults) to injuries or to acute infections of the lungs</p>

				        	<p><span>Anaemia:</span> reduced red blood cell count below physiologically healthy level</p>

				        	<p><span>Antithymocyte globulin:</span> an infusion of horse- or rabbit-derived antibodies against human T cells used in the prevention of post-transplant organ rejection and the treatment of aplastic anaemia</p>

				        	<p><span>Aplastic anaemia:</span> a rare but heterogeneous disorder characterised by bone marrow failure. Aplastic anaemia may be inherited, secondary to an identifiable factor, or be idiopathic (unknown cause)</p>

				        	<p><span>Apoptosis:</span> the process of programmed cell death</p>

				        	<p><span>Bone marrow:</span> a flexible tissue in the interior of bones, consisting of yellow marrow (mainly fat cells) and red marrow (mainly haematopoietic tissue). It is the site of haematopoiesis in adults</p>

				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>CD34:</span> a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of early haematopoietic (multipotent stem cells) and vascular-associated tissue</p>

							<p><span>Cytogenetic abnormalities:</span> a known complication of severe aplastic anaemia, characterised by recruitment of cytogenetically abnormal haematopoietic stem cells, which can lead to disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia </p>

							<p><span>Dyskeratosis congenita:</span> a rare inherited disorder arising from one or more mutations affecting the telomerase RNA component (TERC)</p>	

							<p><span>Erythropoietin (EPO):</span> glycoprotein hormone produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney to regulate red blood cell production in the bone marrow</p>

							<p><span>Fanconi anaemia:</span> an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome resulting from mutations in a cluster of proteins involved in DNA repair</p>
							
							<p><span>Graft-versus-host disease:</span> a common complication after an allogeneic tissue transplant in which immune cells in the transplanted tissue (the graft) recognise recipient (the host) as foreign. The transplanted immune cells then attack the host's body cells</p>
				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF):</span> cytokine that stimulates the bone marrow to produce granulocytes</p>

							<p><span>Haematopoiesis:</span> the formation of blood cellular components from haematopoietic stem cells</p>

							<p>Haematopoietic stem cells:</span> totipotent cells that can differentiate to form lymphoid or myeloid pluripotent cells. Pluripotent stem cells give rise to different stem cells committed to a single blood cell line</p>	

							<p><span>Haploidentical:</span> donor and recipient both have the same alleles at a set of closely linked genes on one chromosome. This ensures a good match and reduces the likelihood of transplant rejection</p>

							<p><span>Human leukocyte antigens:</span> a diverse class of peptides expressed on the surface of immune cells</p>
							
							<p><span>Interstitial pneumonia:</span> bacterial, viral or fungal infection of the lung interstitium (the tissue and space around the air sacs of the lungs)</p>
				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>Myelodysplasia:</span> a diverse collection of haematological disorders characterised by ineffective production of myeloid blood cells, resulting in cytopenias</p>

							<p><span>Pancytopenia:</span> reduced numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets </p>

							<p><span>Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria:</span> a consequence of non-malignant clonal expansion of one or more haematopoietic stem cells resulting in haemolysis and other bone marrow abnormalities. It often arises with bone marrow failure syndromes, including aplastic anaemia</p>	

							<p><span>Reticulin:</span> supportive mesh in soft tissues (such as the liver and bone marrow), composed of type III collagen</p>

							<p><span>Sickle cell anaemia:</span> hereditary blood disorder characterised by abnormally rigid sickle-shaped red blood cells</p>
							
							<p><span>Thrombocytopenia:</span> reduced platelet count below physiologically healthy levels</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span>By the end of this module you should be able to:</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Describe the key components of the blood and their main characteristics</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>To understand how blood composition differs in healthy and disease states</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Understand the origin of these components and how their production is regulated</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>This will help to elucidate the mechanism of action of eltrombopag (detailed in Module 3)</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Discuss the role of the bone marrow in haematopoiesis</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>This will help to understand how conditions such as aplastic anaemia arise from bone marrow failure (detailed in Module 2)</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Explain the key processes involved in the human immune response and the proposed mechanisms behind autoimmunity</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>It is thought that acquired aplastic anaemia is associated with autoimmune destruction of the bone marrow</span></li>
