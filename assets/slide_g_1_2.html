				<p><span>Granulocyte:</span> a collective term for neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, which are characterised by the presence of cytoplasmic granules</p>

				<p><span>Haematopoiesis:</span> the formation of blood cellular components from haematopoietic stemÂ cells</p>

				<p><span>Haematopoietic stem cells:</span> totipotent cells that can differentiate to form lymphoid or myeloid pluripotent cells. Pluripotent stem cells give rise to different stem cells committed to a single blood cell line</p>
