				<p><span>Adaptive immunity:</span> targeted immune response against pathogens that have been previously encountered by the immune system. Deregulation of this response leads to autoimmunity</p>

				<p><span>Antigen-presenting cell:</span> an assorted group of immune cells that mediate the cellular immune response by processing and presenting antigens to the T cells</p>

				<p><span>B-cell:</span> a type of lymphocyte that produce antibodies against antigens; B-cells act as antigen-presenting cells and develop into memory cells after activation by antigen interaction</p>	

				<p><span>Bone marrow:</span> a flexible tissue in the interior of bones, consisting of yellow marrow (mainly fat cells) and red marrow (mainly haematopoietic tissue). It is the site of haematopoiesis in adults</p>

				<p><span>Colony-forming units:</span> haematopoietic progenitor cells of various types, which differentiate into pre-determined mature cell types, following stimulation by cytokines and other factors</p>
				
				<p><span>Colony-stimulating factors:</span> glycoproteins that stimulate stem cells in the bone marrow to promote the production of white blood cells (mainly granulocytes) in response to infection</p>

				<p><span>Cytokines:</span> a diverse family of soluble proteins and peptides that regulate cellular functions and interactions. Haematopoietic growth factors are a subset of cytokines</p>
