				        	<p><span>Adaptive immunity:</span> targeted immune response against pathogens that have been previously encountered by the immune system. Deregulation of this response leads to autoimmunity</p>

							<p><span>Antigen-presenting cell:</span> an assorted group of immune cells that mediate the cellular immune response by processing and presenting antigens to the T cells</p>

							<p><span>B cell:</span> a type of lymphocyte that produce antibodies against antigens; B cells act as antigen-presenting cells and develop into memory cells after activation by antigen interaction</p>	

							<p><span>Bone marrow:</span> a flexible tissue in the interior of bones, consisting of yellow marrow (mainly fat cells) and red marrow (mainly haematopoietic tissue). It is the site of haematopoiesis in adults</p>

							<p><span>Colony-forming units:</span> haematopoietic progenitor cells of various types, which differentiate into pre-determined mature cell types, following stimulation by cytokines and other factors</p>
							
							<p><span>Colony-stimulating factors:</span> glycoproteins that stimulate stem cells in the bone marrow to promote the production of white blood cells (mainly granulocytes) in response to infection</p>

							<p><span>Cytokines:</span> a diverse family of soluble proteins and peptides that regulate cellular functions and interactions. Haematopoietic growth factors are a subset of cytokines</p>
				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>CD4:</span> a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of immune cells such as T-helper cells, monocytes and macrophages</p>

							<p><span>CD8:</span> a glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells</p>

							<p><span>Erythrocyte:</span> red blood cell</p>	

							<p><span>Erythropoietin:</span> a glycoprotein hormone produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney to regulate red blood cell production in the bone marrow</p>

							<p><span>Extracellular matrix:</span> a structural network within the bone marrow that serves as an anchor for haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells</p>
							
							<p><span>Granulocyte:</span> a collective term for neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, which are characterised by the presence of cytoplasmic granules</p>

							<p><span>Haematopoiesis:</span> the formation of blood cellular components from haematopoietic stem cells</p>

							<p><span>Haematopoietic stem cells:</span> totipotent cells that can differentiate to form lymphoid or myeloid pluripotent cells. Pluripotent stem cells give rise to different stem cells committed to a single blood cell line</p>
				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>Innate immunity:</span> also known as non-specific immunity; first line of host defence from infection by other organisms in a non-specific manner</p>

							<p><span>Interleukins:</span> a group of cytokines secreted by immune cells which mediate inter and intra-cellular signalling within the immune system. Interleukins are fundamental to the  regulation of both the cellular and inflammatory immune response, cellular development, growth and differentiation</p>

							<p><span>Leukocyte:</span> white blood cell</p>	

							<p><span>Lymphocyte:</span> the key cellular component of the adaptive immune system. The three major types are T cells, B cells and natural killer cells</p>

							<p><span>Major histocompatibility complex:</span> cell surface molecules that mediate leukocyte interactions. MHC class II mediates immunisation against a given antigen and MHC I mediates destruction of host cells displaying that antigen</p>
							
							<p><span>Megakaryocyte:</span> a progenitor cell of the platelet lineage</p>

							<p><span>Phagocytosis:</span> a mechanism by which pathogens and cell debris are removed</p>

							<p><span>Plasma:</span> a pale yellow solution of electrolytes, proteins and small molecules including glucose</p>
				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>Pancytopenia:</span> a reduction in the number of red cells, white cells and platelets</p>

							<p><span>Reticulocyte:</span> an immature red blood cell</p>

							<p><span>Stroma:</span> all tissues not directly involved in the marrow’s primary function of haematopoiesis</p>	

							<p><span>T cell:</span> a type of lymphocyte that plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity. Subsets of T cells have distinct functions</p>

							<p><span>Thrombocytes:</span> also known as platelets</p>
							
							<p><span>Thrombopoietin:</span> a glycoprotein hormone produced by the liver and kidney that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span>By the end of this module you should be able to:</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Describe the key components of the blood and their main characteristics</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>To understand how blood composition differs in healthy and disease states</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Understand the origin of these components and how their production is regulated</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>This will help to elucidate the mechanism of action of eltrombopag (detailed in Module 3)</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Discuss the role of the bone marrow in haematopoiesis</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>This will help to understand how conditions such as aplastic anaemia arise from bone marrow failure (detailed in Module 2)</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Explain the key processes involved in the human immune response and the proposed mechanisms behind autoimmunity</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>It is thought that acquired aplastic anaemia is associated with autoimmune destruction of the bone marrow</span></li>
