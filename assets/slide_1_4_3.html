					<ul>
						<li><span>The blood is composed of three main cell types: erythrocytes, leukocytes and thrombocytes</span></li>
						<li><span>In adults, the continued production of these cells depends on the presence of HSCs in the bone marrow</span></li>
						<li><span>Growth and differentiation of the different types of blood cells is governed by a complex interplay of cytokines, including EPO, TPO and G-CSF</span></li>
						<li><span>The innate and adaptive arms of the immune system interact to recognise “self” and eliminate foreign antigens</span></li>
						<li><span>Autoimmune conditions, including aplastic anaemia, are thought to arise from an inability of the immune system to recognise the body’s own tissues</span></li>
