				        	<p><span>Antithymocyte globulin:</span> an infusion of horse- or rabbit-derived antibodies against human T cells used in the prevention of post-transplant organ rejection and the treatment of aplastic anaemia</p>

				        	<p><span>Aplastic anaemia:</span> a rare but heterogeneous disorder characterised by bone marrow failure. Aplastic anaemia may be inherited, secondary to an identifiable factor, or be idiopathic (unknown cause)</p>

				        	<p><span>Bone marrow:</span> a flexible tissue in the interior of bones, consisting of yellow marrow (mainly fat cells) and red marrow (mainly haematopoietic tissue). It is the site of haematopoiesis in adults</p>

				        	<p><span>Cytogenetic abnormalities:</span> a complication of severe aplastic anaemia, characterised by recruitment of cytogenetically abnormal haematopoietic stem cells, which can lead to disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia</p>

				        	<p><span>Haematopoiesis:</span> the formation of blood cellular components from haematopoietic stem cells</p>

				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>Haematopoietic stem cells:</span> totipotent cells that can differentiate to form lymphoid or myeloid pluripotent cells. Pluripotent stem cells give rise to different stem cells committed to a single blood cell line</p>

				        	<p><span>Pancytopenia:</span> reduced numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets</p>

				        	<p><span>Thrombocytopenia:</span> reduced platelet count below physiologically healthy levels</p>

				        	<p><span>Thrombopoietin (TPO):</span> a glycoprotein hormone produced by the liver and kidney that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow</p>

				        	<p><span>Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R):</span> a protein encoded by the <i>c-mpl</i> gene that mediates the activity of TPO and is found on all haematopoietic stem cells</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span>By the end of this module you should be able to:</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Understand that thrombopoietin (TPO) is an endogenous platelet growth factor thought to play a pleiotropic role in haematopoiesis</span>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Eltrombopag is a TPO receptor (TPO-R) agonist that stimulates haematopoiesis of early haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), thus providing a mechanistically new treatment option in patients who have no other treatment options</span></li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Recognise that eltrombopag can effectively increase platelet levels irrespective of whether TPO levels are low or high</span>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Eltrombopag is effective in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), where TPO levels are inappropriately low </span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>Indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy</span></li>
									<li><span>Also indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based therapy</span></li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<li><span>Efficacy of eltrombopag has also been demonstrated in aplastic anaemia, where TPO levels are highly elevated</span></li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Understand the details of the clinical trials and the outcomes relating to eltrombopag use in severe aplastic anaemia (SAA)</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>Preclinical data in mice show that eltrombopag can stimulate multilineage haematopoiesis </span></li>
									<li><span>Phase II results demonstrate that eltrombopag can improve haematopoiesis in ≥1 cell lineage in patients with refractory aplastic anaemia</span>
										<ul>
											<li><span>A multilineage haematological response was observed in some patients, with an increase in platelet, red blood cell (RBC) and neutrophil levels after treatment with eltrombopag</span></li>
											<li><span>The number of cell lineages that met haematological response improved over time for some patients</span></li>
											<li><span>Response was maintained in patients whose treatment was tapered because of improvements in defined multilineage blood counts (platelets, erythrocytes and neutrophils)</span></li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Appreciate that cytogenetic abnormalities and subsequent evolution to haematological malignancies are known long-term risks in patients with bone marrow disorders, particularly in patients with SAA</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>Patients with aplastic anaemia are at risk for developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)</span></li>
