				<p><span>Innate immunity:</span> also known as non-specific immunity; first line of host defence from infection by other organisms in a non-specific manner</p>

				<p><span>Interleukins:</span> a group of cytokines secreted by immune cells which mediate inter and intra-cellular signalling within the immune system. Interleukins are fundamental to the  regulation of both the cellular and inflammatory immune response, cellular development, growth and differentiation</p>

				<p><span>Leukocyte:</span> white blood cell</p>	

				<p><span>Lymphocyte:</span> the key cellular component of the adaptive immune system. The three major types are T cells, B-cells and natural killer cells</p>

				<p><span>Major histocompatibility complex:</span> cell surface molecules that mediate leukocyte interactions. MHC class II mediates immunisation against a given antigen and MHC I mediates destruction of host cells displaying that antigen</p>
				
				<p><span>Megakaryocyte:</span> a progenitor cell of the platelet lineage</p>

				<p><span>Phagocytosis:</span> a mechanism by which pathogens and cell debris are removed</p>

				<p><span>Plasma:</span> a pale yellow solution of electrolytes, proteins and small molecules includingÂ glucose</p>
