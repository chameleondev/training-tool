				        	<p><span>Antithymocyte globulin:</span> an infusion of horse- or rabbit-derived antibodies against human T cells used in the prevention of post-transplant organ rejection and the treatment of aplastic anaemia</p>

				        	<p><span>Aplastic anaemia:</span> a rare but heterogeneous disorder characterised by bone marrow failure. Aplastic anaemia may be inherited, secondary to an identifiable factor, or be idiopathic (unknown cause)</p>

				        	<p><span>Bone marrow:</span> a flexible tissue in the interior of bones, consisting of yellow marrow (mainly fat cells) and red marrow (mainly haematopoietic tissue). It is the site of haematopoiesis in adults</p>

				        	<p><span>Cytogenetic abnormalities:</span> a complication of severe aplastic anaemia, characterised by recruitment of cytogenetically abnormal haematopoietic stem cells, which can lead to disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia</p>

				        	<p><span>Haematopoiesis:</span> the formation of blood cellular components from haematopoietic stem cells</p>

				        </div>
				        <div>
				        	<p><span>Haematopoietic stem cells:</span> totipotent cells that can differentiate to form lymphoid or myeloid pluripotent cells. Pluripotent stem cells give rise to different stem cells committed to a single blood cell line</p>

				        	<p><span>Pancytopenia:</span> reduced numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets</p>

				        	<p><span>Thrombocytopenia:</span> reduced platelet count below physiologically healthy levels</p>

				        	<p><span>Thrombopoietin (TPO):</span> a glycoprotein hormone produced by the liver and kidney that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow</p>

				        	<p><span>Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R):</span> a protein encoded by the c-mpl gene that mediates the activity of TPO and is found on all haematopoietic stem cells</p>

					<li><span>By the end of this module you should be able to:</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Explain what aplastic anaemia is and differentiate between the main types of disease</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>To understand the new proposed indication for eltrombopag for the treatment of this condition</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Describe the pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anaemia</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>It is thought that acquired aplastic anaemia arises from autoimmune destruction of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>Discuss the current standards of care for severe aplastic anaemia and their advantages and limitations</span>
								<ul>
									<li><span>To recognise the unmet needs in the management of severe aplastic anaemia
									</span></li>
